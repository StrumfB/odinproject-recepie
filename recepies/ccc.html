        <h4>Recipe instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Combine well.</li>
            <li>In a separate large bowl, add butter, white sugar and brown sugar. Whisk together (using a hand mixer, if available) until well combined. Then, whisk in eggs and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Gradually add in flour mixture and combine to a uniform consistency.</li>
            <li>Add in chocolate chips. Use a spoon or fork to mix them into the dough.</li>
            <li>If time allows, cover the bowl with cling wrap and refrigerate at least one hour, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Using a cookie scoop (about 3 tablespoons), create dough balls and arrange them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>If you have kids helping, they can roll the scoops into little spheres, or “meatballs” as kids call them.</li>
            <li>Bake in an oven preheated to 375°F for 8-11 minutes (depending on your oven). They should have a slightly undercooked appearance, just beginning to brown up.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
