    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol><li>Place the 16 ounces mascarpone cheese and 8 ounces cream cheese for the filling in the bowl of a stand mixer. (Alternatively, place in a large bowl if using an electric hand mixer.) Let sit at room temperature until softened, about 1 hour.</li></ol>
    <h5>To make the crust:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 stick unsalted butter in the microwave or on the stovetop.</li>
        <li>Break 7 ounces crisp ladyfingers in half and place in a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process until fine crumbs form, about 15 seconds. Add the melted butter, 1 tablespoon Dutch process cocoa powder, and 1 teaspoon espresso powder. Process until a handful of crumbs holds together when squeezed, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl halfway through, about 30 seconds total.</li>
        <li>Transfer the crumbs to a 9-inch round springform pan. Using your hands or the bottom of a dry measuring cup, press the crumbs firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Freeze while you make the filling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>To make the filling</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt to the bowl of mascarpone and cream cheeses. Beat with the paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream, 1/4 cup coffee-flavored liqueur, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Replace the paddle with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the crust from the freezer. Transfer half the filling (about 2 1/2 cups) onto the crust and spread it into an even layer that reaches all the way to the sides of the pan. Refrigerate the crust and remaining filling while you prepare the ladyfingers.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>To make the soaked ladyfingers:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 3/4 cup boiling water and 1 tablespoon espresso powder in a small bowl and whisk until the powder is dissolved. Add 1/4 cup coffee-flavored liqueur and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the crust and remaining filling from the refrigerator. Arrange 4 ounces (about 14) crisp ladyfingers onto the filling in a single tight layer, breaking them up as needed so that there are no gaps, especially around the edges of the pan.</li>
        <li>Working with 1 ladyfinger at a time, remove from the pan. Quickly dip the entire finger in the coffee mixture until just dampened but not soaked, 2 to 3 seconds, then return to its original spot.</li>
        <li>Evenly spread the remaining filling over the soaked ladyfingers. Cover the pan in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 6 hours or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, unlock and remove the sides of the pan. Generously dust the top of the cake with a thick layer of Dutch process cocoa powder. Slice and serve with more cocoa powder dusted on top.</li>
    </ol>
